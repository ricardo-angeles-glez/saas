# Profiles Table Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive profiles system with automatic user profile creation, Row Level Security (RLS), and a complete TypeScript type system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **Table**: `profiles` with the following fields:
  - `id` (UUID, Primary Key, References auth.users)
  - `first_name` (TEXT, Optional)
  - `avatar_url` (TEXT, Optional) 
  - `email` (TEXT, Required)
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, Auto-generated)
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, Auto-updated)

### 2. Database Triggers
- **Auto Profile Creation**: When a new user signs up, a profile record is automatically created
- **Updated At Trigger**: Automatically updates the `updated_at` field on profile changes

### 3. Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Policies Implemented**:
  - Users can view their own profile
  - Users can update their own profile
  - Users can insert their own profile (for manual creation)
  - Users can delete their own profile
- **Security**: All policies use `auth.uid() = id` to ensure users can only access their own data

### 4. TypeScript Types
- **Database Types**: Complete type definitions for the profiles table
- **Profile Types**: Extended types for profile operations
- **Auth Types**: Authentication-related type definitions
- **Modular Structure**: Individual type files organized by domain

### 5. Server Functions
- **Profile Service**: Core functions for CRUD operations
- **Server Actions**: Next.js server actions for profile management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with Supabase client

### 6. UI Components
- **Profile Form**: Complete form for viewing and editing profiles
- **Integration**: Added to the protected dashboard page
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error handling, and success feedback

```

## Key Features

### Automatic Profile Creation
When a user signs up through Supabase Auth, a profile record is automatically created with their email address.

### Type Safety
Full TypeScript integration ensures type safety across the entire application.

### Security
Row Level Security policies ensure users can only access and modify their own profile data.

### User Experience
- Clean, responsive UI using Shadcn components
- Real-time form validation and feedback
- Loading states and error handling

## Usage

### For New Users
1. User signs up through the auth system
2. Profile is automatically created via database trigger
3. User can immediately access and edit their profile

### For Existing Users
1. Navigate to `/protected` (dashboard)
2. View and edit profile information
3. Changes are saved with automatic timestamp updates

## Database Migration Applied
The migration has been successfully applied to your remote Supabase instance using `supabase db push`.

## Next Steps
- Test the profile functionality by signing up a new user
- Customize the profile form fields as needed
- Add additional profile fields if required
- Implement profile image upload functionality if needed

## Security Notes
- All profile operations are protected by RLS policies
- Users can only access their own profile data
- Server-side validation ensures data integrity
- TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
